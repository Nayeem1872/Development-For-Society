                <p>Development for Society is an association of individuals who have deep concern and social commitment for public cause and interest. It came in to being in 1996 as a response to the widely felt needs of the poor, the destitute and the most vulnerable groups in the community. It started its activities as go in Mia Bazar of Chouddugram Upazila in Comilla District. With the passage of time, it has celebrated its 24th birth anniversary. Though not so fast, it has a steady growth. It has been now operating its development programs with potentials in nine Upazilas of four districts. During the time, it has grown up and reached its adolescence with diversity of programs and it achieved notable success in program development and management. The program has been developed through the learning experience in directly working with the community people. The program has not developed; rather evolved through the active participation of the community people in identifying their needs, hopes and aspirations. We work towards a sustainable development in solidarity with the poor. We work with the people; not by the people and not for the people. We work with the people to liberate them from hunger, disease, ignorance and oppression and facilitate them to move ahead towards life, solidarity, integrity, love and decent living. We catalyst the social movement and action of the people to visualize and dream about a more human future beyond the fractured and struggled present. We are committed to create and recreate a better world, where every body will lead a life of peace, harmony and dignity.</p>

<p>Presently, Development for Society has been operating a variety of socio-economic and socio-cultural programs aims at sustainable development of the poor in its field areas. It has reached in 275 villages of 12 Upazilas under four districts covering more than 428,305 direct beneficiaries. The direct beneficiaries include landless laborers, marginal farmers and the destitute people particularly the women and children.</p>

<p>During the recent time, its reproductive health services to the poor has strengthened; training courses for human resource development and occupational skills training are regularly scheduled for self-employment.  Promotion agriculture and fisheries and providing them with agricultural input are highly appreciated in the community. DS micro- credit program is on increased mode to meet up the growing needs of the beneficiaries for their economic empowerment. Additionally, entrepreneurship development has been patronized among the women entrepreneurs for starting up and expanding their business. In operating micro-credit program, DS has earned specialty in offering Credit plus Services to the valued group members. The Credit plus Services are genuinely linked with other essential services like general & reproductive health services, training, education and agricultural input delivery to the beneficiaries. The micro- finance program of DS is an alternative credit facility to the formal banking to the poor. It may be noted that the recovery rate is highly satisfactory and it is 100%. Development for Society is well prepared to expand its loan portfolio in its microfinance and micro-enterprise development program to promote self-employment by the poor to reach the Million Development Goal in poverty reduction. In the reporting year, DS has strengthened its dialogue with the financial institutions to expand its micro-credit program to meet up the growing needs of the beneficiaries.</p>

<p>There is no denying that it has been potentially contributing to the GDP and economic growth of the country through promoting crops diversification, increasing crops intensity and crop production and introducing modern agricultural equipments along with other low-cost technologies. Development for Society has given equal and prime importance for poverty reduction through self-employment and promotion of nutritional fulfillment of the beneficiaries through poultry and duck rearing, fish cultivation and lives stock development at the village level. For social empowerment, it has demonstrated its excellence in creating an opportunity for basic education to the children of the poor. It has reached the street children, working children and adolescent boys and girls living in the slums. The children either have never been enrolled in a formal school or have been dropped out. To this end, the strategic plan of Development for Society appears with a new dimensions incorporating functional application of literacy skills in post-literacy and continuing education to the neo-literates through a comprehensive and innovative methods of non-formal and formal primary education.</p>

<p>In order to combat ill health of the beneficiaries, Development for Society is offering essential health services to the community people and it has been making notable contribution for the overall health status of the poor. With a view to prevent malnutrition which is a silent disaster throughout the year for the poor, it has reinforced its nutrition program to prevent child mortality. The essential health services are organized through satellite clinics.
